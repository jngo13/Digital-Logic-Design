# Digital-Logic-Design

My completed labs from CS 2330 at the University of Virginia.

Includes analysis and design of digital systems— switches, gates, etc. and analysis and design of sequential components— multiplexers, demultiplexers, decoders, encoders, comparators, adders and ALU, and registers.
